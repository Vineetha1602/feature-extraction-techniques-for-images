# Feature Extraction Techniques for Images

## ‚ùì Why do we need feature extraction?

Raw images contain a lot of information, but not all of it is useful for analysis. Feature extraction helps identify key patterns, textures, and structures, making it easier for machine learning models to understand and process images efficiently.

## üñºÔ∏è Where is feature extraction used?

Feature extraction is widely used in image classification, object detection, medical imaging, and many other computer vision tasks.

## üöÄ What can I learn from this project?

This project covers a diverse set of feature extraction techniques, each designed to capture different aspects of an image:

- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) ‚Äì Captures gradient orientations to detect object shapes and structures, widely used in object recognition.

- Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) ‚Äì Identifies key points in an image that remain robust to scaling and rotation, making it useful for image matching and recognition.

- Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) ‚Äì Extracts texture features by analyzing the spatial relationship between pixel intensities.

- Fourier Transform ‚Äì Converts images into the frequency domain, helping analyze patterns and structures that are not easily visible in the spatial domain.

- Gabor Filters ‚Äì Simulates the human visual system to extract texture and edge information, often used for texture classification and face recognition.

- Gradient Location and Orientation Histogram (GLOH) ‚Äì Combines gradient orientation histograms with spatial distribution around keypoints, providing a robust descriptor for object recognition, image matching, and texture analysis.

Each technique provides unique insights into image data, allowing for a comprehensive approach to feature extraction in various computer vision applications.
